# Motia Monorepo

This repository hosts the development of **Motia.js**, a framework for building event-driven business automation flows. The repository is structured to facilitate the iterative development and testing of the core framework and includes a playground environment for real-world use cases.

## Overview

Motia.js aims to simplify the creation and scaling of event-driven flows by:

- Providing a **core framework** for defining flows as collections of testable components.
- Supporting **real-time event handling** with loose coupling between components.
- Offering tools for **UI-based flow visualization**.
- Enabling seamless **integration with external APIs** like Google Drive and OpenAI.

### Aspirational Vision

Motia.js strives to be:

- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy to adopt and extend.
- **Production-Ready**: Scales gracefully from prototypes to enterprise-grade flows.
- **Integration-First**: Works seamlessly with third-party tools and services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Python** (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** (for managing the monorepo)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd motia-monorepo
   ```

2. Install Motia CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g motia
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the example `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp playground/.env.example playground/.env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your credentials and API keys.

### Running the Playground

The playground allows you to test and refine flows built using Motia.js.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command starts the following services:

- **MotiaCore**: The flow orchestrator.
- **MotiaServer**: Provides HTTP endpoints for triggering flows.
- **Playground UI**: A React-based visualization tool for flows.

The app runs locally at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

## How to Contribute

### Development Flow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```

2. Make changes to the codebase.

   - Framework changes: Update `packages/core`.
   - Flow examples: Update `playground/src/flows`.

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   pnpm run test
   ```

4. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add <your-feature-description>"
   git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```

5. Open a pull request on GitHub.

### Code Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style (Prettier and ESLint are configured).
- Write unit tests for new features and components.
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.

## Roadmap

- Expand the set of example flows.
- Enhance the visualization capabilities of the playground.
- Improve documentation for public release.
- Publish `motia` to npm with comprehensive guides and examples.
