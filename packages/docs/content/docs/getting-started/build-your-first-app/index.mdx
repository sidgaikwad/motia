# Build Your First Complete Motia App

**Learn Motia by building a real application step-by-step.** This tutorial series guides you through creating a complete pet store application, starting with basic API endpoints and progressively adding advanced features.

## What You'll Build 🎯

A **complete pet store application** that demonstrates real-world patterns:
- ✅ **REST API** with full CRUD operations
- ✅ **Background job processing** for automated tasks  
- ⏳ **Workflows** for complex business logic
- ⏳ **AI Agents** for intelligent automation
- ⏳ **Real-time Streams** for live updates
- ⏳ **Database integration** and state management

## Learning Path 📚

This is a **progressive tutorial series**. Each section builds on the previous one:

### 1. API Endpoints (Start Here)
**Build your foundation with REST APIs**
- Create, read, update, and delete pets
- Request validation and error handling
- HTTP methods and proper responses

[**Start with API Endpoints →**](/docs/getting-started/build-your-first-app/creating-your-first-rest-api)

---

### 2. Background Jobs
**Add automated processing to your API**
- Event-driven architecture  
- Scheduled tasks and cron jobs
- Async processing without blocking APIs

[**Continue with Background Jobs →**](/docs/getting-started/build-your-first-app/build-your-first-background-jobs)

---

### 3. Workflows *(Coming Next)*
**Orchestrate complex business processes**
- Multi-step workflows with conditional logic
- Sequential and parallel processing
- Error handling and retries across steps

*Available soon*

---

### 4. AI Agents *(Coming Next)*
**Integrate intelligent automation**
- LLM-powered decision making
- AI-driven data processing
- Automated content generation and analysis

*Available soon*

---

### 5. Real-time Streams *(Coming Next)*
**Add live updates and data streams**
- WebSocket connections and live updates
- Real-time data streaming and processing
- Live notifications and collaboration features

*Available soon*

## Prerequisites ✅

- [Complete Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) tutorial
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript or Python

## Why This Progression? 🤔

**APIs First**: Learn the foundation - how to create endpoints and handle requests.

**Background Jobs Next**: Add real-world functionality - automated emails, scheduled tasks, and async processing that every application needs.

**Workflows Then**: Orchestrate complex business logic that spans multiple steps and systems with conditional branching.

**AI Agents Next**: Integrate intelligent automation - let AI make decisions, process data, and generate content within your workflows.

**Real-time Streams Finally**: Add live capabilities - real-time updates, notifications, and collaborative features that make your app interactive.
